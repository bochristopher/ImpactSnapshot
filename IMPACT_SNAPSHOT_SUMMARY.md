# Impact Snapshot - Project Summary

## 🎯 What We Built

**Impact Snapshot** is a real-time dashboard that demonstrates the direct impact of technical issues on business metrics. It shows how a broken "Pay Now" button leads to lost revenue, and how quick fixes can save real money.

## ✅ Front-end/UI Engineer Checklist Progress

- ✅ Basic project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### 15-35 minutes - Basic Layout ✅
- ✅ Created flex-column container with "Impact Snapshot" heading
- ✅ Built SnapshotCard component that takes props: arr_risk, endpoint, rollback_url
- ✅ Inserted cards with dummy numbers for styling

### 35-60 minutes - Hook Live Data ✅
- ✅ Created config with BACKEND = "http://localhost:8000"
- ✅ Implemented fetch(${BACKEND}/snapshot) in useEffect equivalent

- ✅ Replaced dummy props with real data from fetch

### 60-85 minutes - WebSocket Updates ✅
- ✅ Added WebSocket connection with polling fallback
- ✅ Tested with backend /inject endpoint

## 🏆 Demo Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Imagine you run a small online shop. On an ordinary Friday afternoon, the 'Pay Now' button suddenly starts throwing errors. Shoppers click, nothing happens, they leave. Every lost checkout is real money leaking out.

This is Impact Snapshot - a dashboard that notices the error spike within seconds, calculates how many dollars are slipping away, offers a one-click rollback, and shows traffic bouncing back to normal."

### Demo Flow (2 minutes)
1. **Show healthy state** - "Everything is green, conversion at 85%"
2. **Click warning state** - "Watch the dashboard turn yellow, $2,100 at risk"
3. **Click critical state** - "Now it's red, $8,400 at immediate risk, rollback button appears"
4. **Click rollback** - "One click and everything returns to normal"
5. **Show mobile** - "Scan the QR code, works perfectly on your phone"

### Closing (30 seconds)
"Impact Snapshot shows the direct line from bug → lost dollars → fix → recovered dollars. It's visually punchy yet simple enough to finish in an afternoon. The judges love seeing real-time impact on business metrics."
