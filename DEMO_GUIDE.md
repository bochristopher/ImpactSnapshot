# Impact Snapshot - Demo Guide

## üéØ What We Built

Impact Snapshot is a real-time dashboard that shows the direct impact of technical issues on business metrics. When the "Pay Now" button breaks, shoppers leave and money leaks. This dashboard notices the error spike, calculates lost dollars, offers a one-click rollback, and shows traffic recovering - all in real-time.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ (already installed)
- Web browser
- Mobile device for QR code testing

### Setup (Already Done!)
1. ‚úÖ Backend API running on `http://localhost:8000`
2. ‚úÖ Frontend dashboard running on `http://localhost:3000`
3. ‚úÖ QR code generation for mobile access
4. ‚úÖ Real-time data polling every 6 seconds
5. ‚úÖ Demo controls for error simulation

## üéÆ Demo Flow

### Step 1: Show Healthy State
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
- Notice the green status cards showing:
  - $0 ARR at Risk
  - 0 Error Count  
  - 85.0% Conversion Rate
- The QR code is generated automatically for mobile access

### Step 2: Simulate Warning State
- Click the **"Warning State"** button
- Watch the dashboard turn yellow and show:
  - $2,100 ARR at Risk
  - 15 Error Count
  - 72.0% Conversion Rate
- Notice the real-time chart updating

### Step 3: Simulate Critical State
- Click the **"Critical State"** button
- Watch the dashboard turn red and show:
  - $8,400 ARR at Risk
  - 47 Error Count
  - 31.0% Conversion Rate
- The **"Roll Back Release"** button appears

### Step 4: Demonstrate Rollback
- Click the **"Roll Back Release"** button
- Watch the dashboard return to green healthy state
- All metrics return to normal levels

### Step 5: Mobile Testing
- Scan the QR code with your phone
- Verify the dashboard loads and is responsive
- Test the demo controls on mobile

## üì± Mobile Features

- **QR Code**: Automatically generated for the current URL
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Touch-Friendly**: Buttons are large enough for mobile interaction
- **Real-Time Updates**: Same polling as desktop version

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend (FastAPI)
- `/snapshot` - Main endpoint returning aggregated data
- `/inject-error` - Simulates error injection for demo
- `/rollback` - Triggers rollback workflow
- CORS enabled for frontend communication

### Frontend (Vanilla JS + Tailwind)
- Real-time data polling every 6 seconds
- WebSocket support (falls back to polling)
- Chart.js for time series visualization
- QR code generation for mobile access
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### Demo Controls
- **Healthy State**: $0 risk, 85% conversion
- **Warning State**: $2,100 risk, 72% conversion  
- **Critical State**: $8,400 risk, 31% conversion

## üèÜ Demo Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Imagine you run a small online shop. On an ordinary Friday afternoon, the 'Pay Now' button suddenly starts throwing errors. Shoppers click, nothing happens, they leave. Every lost checkout is real money leaking out.

This is Impact Snapshot - a dashboard that notices the error spike within seconds, calculates how many dollars are slipping away, offers a one-click rollback, and shows traffic bouncing back to normal."

### Demo Flow (2 minutes)
1. **Show healthy state** - "Everything is green, conversion at 85%"
2. **Click warning state** - "Watch the dashboard turn yellow, $2,100 at risk"
3. **Click critical state** - "Now it's red, $8,400 at immediate risk, rollback button appears"
4. **Click rollback** - "One click and everything returns to normal"
5. **Show mobile** - "Scan the QR code, works perfectly on your phone"

### Closing (30 seconds)
"Impact Snapshot shows the direct line from bug ‚Üí lost dollars ‚Üí fix ‚Üí recovered dollars. It's visually punchy yet simple enough to finish in an afternoon. The judges love seeing real-time impact on business metrics."
